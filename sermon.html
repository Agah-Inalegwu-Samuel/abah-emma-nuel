                                        God's kingdom is liking to a building. God is the owner, Holy Spirit is the Supervisor, while Jesus is the Sponsor.
                                        Your church is not the total church of Christ. She's just a part, we all have strength and weaknesses, let's understand our roles and stop working at cross-purposes. The building is only one, and we are all equally hired! The owner expect you to face what you are hired for, not to be another Supervisor. Face your work.
                                        A friend told me his experience. He hated the preaching of Joyce Meyer so much. " This woman should preach the real gospel. The gospel is about Salvation, Heaven and Hell, Sin, Spirituality, Holiness etc. Why is she always encouraging people? This is fake, it's not the real gospel" anytime he sees Joyce Meyer, he's already offended.
                                        One day, he had serious life challenges and was at the verge of committing suicide, though a GO of Ministry.
                                        
                                        In his depressed state, he stumbled on Joyce Meyer preaching her normal" encouragement gospel" . My friend listened and it's like God himself speaking to him. He was greatly encouraged, motivated and rescued from suicide, by the same message and messenger he had despised for years.

                                        That message you don't need is what someone desperately need. Do your own, and let others do theirs. Everyone is answerable to God.

We have a bunch of people today who are churchy, but their jobs, businesses and degrees are more important than their faith in Christ. <br>

                                                                            We have so many politicians who are churchy but can’t represent the kingdom in their Sphere of influence. They will rather chose the portion of the king’s meal than stand for the kingdom. They have a church life and a world life, hypocrites to the core. <br>
                                                                            If Jesus and His kingdom does not have the highest priority over everything in your life, you have not known Him!! <br>

To forget this, is to chase after the wind and become vain. Be deliberate about living for christ.

In spiritual things, it's not everything that's good for the goose that would be good for the gander. Discern yourself and stay with God. 

                                                                                He knows what you need to keep doing so you can become what he has intended for you before you were born. You're not in competition with your brother. You'll not be measured by his performance. RUN your RACE and finish YOUR COURSE.

He showed you those things or gave you those visions as a "bait" to keep you on the path of spiritual progress.
                                                                                
                                                                                Never compromise the authority of scriptures.- Remember anything that does not line up with the spirit inspired and spirit breath word is dangerous.

If nothing can affect your love for him, you'd never break ranks with Him. Keep the flames of his love raging in your heart. Let nothing competes with your love for him. Not even your desire to live. Hmm. Finally;

Jesus referring to it said, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah but unto none of them was Elijah sent but to the widow of Zarephath."

                                                                                                In this time of recession in our nation, please look out through your window of comfort and help a needy neighbour to survive. Don't wait for your Brook to dry up before you make that move.

The man of God was surviving the recession while a widow and her son were down to their last meal.

Church attendance has become the hallmark for a healthy Christian life. You really do wonder why myriads of people gather weekly in buildings and yet God is missing in our streets, neighborhoods and territories.

                                                                                        The light of most believers seems to only shine inside church walls. A different civilization is dominating our schools, political space and every institution. It will amaze you to know the number of believers that don’t have a personal prayer and study life. When you engage them, you discover how shallow and empty many are.

                                                                                        Our corporate life should be an aggregation of who we are individually. Your personal walk with the Lord is more important than your corporate life. It was never Jesus’s desire for the church to become an institutionalized group. We were suppose to be an organic element on earth. Many believers have no life outside church, no walk with the Lord outside corporate duties.

                                                                                         We have entered a season where it shall be all man for himself, it is the God that you know that will sustain you this season, corporate life will be rarely impossible. Only those who know their God shall be strong!
